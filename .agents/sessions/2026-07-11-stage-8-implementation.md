# Stage 8 implementation session

## Session

- Date: 2026-07-11
- Plan: `.agents/plans/2026-07-11-stage-8-coherent-household-mvp-plan.md`
- Branch: `dev/bg/stage8`
- Current objective: Implement Stage 8 through small validated commits, keeping manual checks and decisions explicit.

## Completed

- Item: Step 1 contract/domain foundation implemented: Stage 8 household vocabulary, classification closure/matching, unit conversion, batch ordering, allocation-only aggregation, capabilities, and validators.
- Item: Added the durable domain dictionary at `docs/domain-language.md`.
- Item: Added the typed feature-flag registry/evaluator with explicit defaults, storage-failure behavior, bounded cache, invalidation, revision checks, and audit payload contracts.
- Item: Extended server logging with structured event metadata plus bounded sensitive-detail redaction.

## Validation

- Ran: `npm run typecheck`
- Result: Passed.
- Ran: `npm test -- --run packages/kamra-api-server/src/household/v2/domain.test.ts`
- Result: 5 tests passed.
- Ran: `npm test -- --run packages/kamra-api-server/src/feature-toggles/service.test.ts packages/kamra-api-server/src/logging/kamra-logger.test.ts`
- Result: 5 tests passed.
- Ran: `npx eslint packages/kamra-api-server/src/feature-toggles packages/kamra-api-server/src/logging/kamra-logger.ts`
- Result: Passed.
- Not run: Full test, lint, build, and Mongo transaction smoke; defer until the next meaningful integration unit or closeout.

## Decisions

- Decision: Use a versioned `household/v2` contract area while retaining `v1` as migration input.
- Reason: This matches the approved Stage 8 cutover boundary and prevents new persistence/routes from silently inheriting the one-row stock model.
- Decision: Keep unit/date rules in small pure helpers and validators before persistence.
- Reason: Migration and atomic command code can reuse executable invariants and remain independently testable.

## Open Issues

- Issue: Mongo transaction support and the existing database abstraction still need an explicit Step 1/Step 4 integration check.
- Impact: Do not implement atomic stock commands until the configured topology is proven transaction-capable; revise the plan if it is not.
- Issue: The new feature evaluator/audit contracts are not yet wired into the existing Mongo repository/admin route.
- Impact: Existing runtime behavior is unchanged; Step 2 must add persistence and route integration before the feature/log foundation is complete.
- Issue: UI/API manual verification has not started.
- Impact: Track the final browser checklist as implementation reaches the household workspace.

## Roadmap Or Plan Updates

- Needed: No roadmap change.
- Status: Stage 8 is in implementation; Step 1 is ready for review and commit.

## Next Step

Commit the Step 2 evaluator/logging foundation, then wire it into Mongo persistence and the admin route without changing flag behavior.

## Notes For Future Agent

- Aggregate stock only from active Stock Allocations; never infer counted quantity directly from classification matches.
- `is_a` is child-to-parent and effective concepts are inclusive; attributes remain independent.
- Keep the manual-check list current when UI or live Mongo behavior is introduced.
